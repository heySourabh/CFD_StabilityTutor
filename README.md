# CFD_StabilityTutor
Java tool for understanding stability of few CFD schemes.

You can try out the tool by just using the binary:  
[https://github.com/heySourabh/CFD_StabilityTutor/blob/master/bin/StabilityTutor.jar?raw=true](https://github.com/heySourabh/CFD_StabilityTutor/blob/master/bin/StabilityTutor.jar?raw=true). Double clicking the `StabilityTutor.jar` should be enough to launch the executable if Java is installed on your computer.

This is a tool for CFD learners and CFD teachers to demonstrate the effects of changing parameters like Courant number, space differencing, time differencing, number of divisions and stopping time on the numerical solution of Advection or Diffusion PDE.

Enter the parameters and make selections in the top panel, and then click the play or final solution button.
My advice is to modify only one parameter at a time and observe the effects due to change of the parameter on the solution. This will make you see the effect of the parameter more clearly.

**Please click the 'Read Inputs & Reset' button after changing parameters** to consider the new parameters before clicking play or else old values will be used.
The initialization is automatically done by the program as a combination of various functions.
